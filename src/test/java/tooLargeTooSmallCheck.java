# Too Large Too Small

## Objectives

1. To demonstrate your understanding of objects
2. To demonstrate your understanding of operators
3. To demonstrate your understanding of user input
4. To demonstrate your understanding of functions


## Overview

Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

## Unit Test

No Unit Test

## Instructions

1. Break problem into pieces
2. Solve for each piece of the problem
3. Bring pieces together
4. Print final output to screen
